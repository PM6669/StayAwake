# StayAwake
ActivitySentinel acts as a digital watchman for your work session. It continuously observes user activity and triggers a verification cycle after a configurable idle period. During this cycle, it attempts to confirm presence for a short, limited window. If activity is still absent, the system is allowed to enter idle mode naturally.
